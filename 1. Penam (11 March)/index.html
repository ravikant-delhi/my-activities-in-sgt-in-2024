<h2>Organizers</h2>
An Industrial tour to Penam Laboratories Limited, Joniawas, Dharuhera, Haryana 123110 was organized on Monday, 11 March 2024 for the Post Graduate students. The event was convened by Prof. Vijay Bhalla, Principal SGTCOP. The visit was coordinated by Dr. Silky Sethi along with Dr. Sonia Yadav, Dr. Ravi Kant and Dr. Suman Rohilla, (Associate Professors at SGT College of Pharmacy)
<h2>Report of the Industrial Visit:</h2>
    <p>Penam Laboratories Limited was founded in the year 1989, from a humble beginning. Penam is one of India's renowned producers of Beta Lactam group of Antibiotic Bulk Drugs (APIs) and Formulations.</p>
    <p>The students were received by the management on arrival. Thereafter Dr Jyoti Sharma, Head Quality and Regulatory gave introduction about the company and the manufacturing, R&D and quality control department. A detailed session by her covered the essential components of head         space chromatography instruments and the step-by-step operational procedures. The workshop emphasized the importance of instrument calibration and maintenance to ensure accurate and reliable results.</p>
    <p>The application-focused segment delved into various scenarios where head space chromatography proves invaluable in pharmaceutical analysis. Discussions included the analysis of residual solvents, stability testing, and formulation development.</p>

<h2>Headspace Analysis Using GC</h2>
<p>Most consumer products and biological samples are composed of a wide variety of compounds that differ in molecular weight, polarity, and volatility. For complex samples like these, headspace     sampling is the fastest and cleanest method for analysing volatile organic compounds. A headspace sample is normally prepared in a vial containing the sample, the dilution solvent, a matrix modifier, and the headspace.</p>
<p>Volatile components from complex sample mixtures can be extracted from non-volatile sample components and isolated in the headspace or vapor portion of a sample vial. An aliquot of the vapor in the headspace is delivered to a GC system for separation of all of the volatile components.</p>
<p>The gas phase (G in Figure) is commonly referred to as the headspace and lies above the
condensed sample phase. The sample phase (S in Figure) contains the compound(s) of interest
and is usually in the form of a liquid or solid in combination with a dilution solvent or a matrix
modifier. Once the sample phase is introduced into the vial and the vial is sealed, volatile
components diffuse into the gas phase until the headspace has reached a state of equilibrium as
depicted by the arrows. The sample is then taken from the headspace.</p>
<h2>Basic Principles of Headspace Analysis</h2>
<h3>Partition Coefficient</h3>
<p>Samples must be prepared to maximize the concentration of the volatile components in the     headspace, and minimize unwanted contamination from other compounds in the sample matrix. To help determine the concentration of an analyte in the headspace, you will need to calculate the partition coefficient (K), which is defined by</p>
K = Cs/Cg
<p>where Cs is the concentration of analyte in sample phase and Cg is the concentration of analyte
    in gas phase. Compounds that have low K values will tend to partition more readily into the gas
    phase, and have relatively high responses and low limits of detection. K can be lowered by
    changing the temperature at which the vial is equilibrated or by changing the composition of the
    sample matrix.</p>
<h3>Phase Ratio</h3>
<p>The phase ratio (β) is defined as the relative volume of the headspace compared to volume of the
    sample in the sample vial, where Vs=volume of sample phase and Vg=volume of gas phase. Lower
    values for β (i.e., larger sample size) will yield higher responses for volatile compounds. However,
    decreasing the β value will not always yield the increase in response needed to improve sensitivity.
    When β is decreased by increasing the sample size, compounds with high K values partition less
    into the headspace compared to compounds with low K values, and yield correspondingly smaller
    changes in Cg. Samples that contain compounds with high K values need to be optimized to
    provide the lowest K value before changes are made in the phase ratio.</p>
    β = Vg/Vs
<h3>Case Studies:</h3>
<p>Real-world case studies were presented to highlight the practical implications and success stories
    of employing head space chromatography in pharmaceutical laboratories. These case studies
    showcased the versatility and efficiency of the technique in addressing analytical challenges.The workshop concluded with a dynamic question and answer session, providing participants with
    the chance to seek clarification on specific topics and exchange insights with the workshop
    facilitators.</p>
<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
<p>The Head Space Gas Chromatography workshop at Penam Laboratories Limited proved to be a
    valuable educational experience for participants, fostering a deeper understanding of the
    technique’s principles, applications, and practical implementation in pharmaceutical analysis. The
    case studies enriched the learning process, equipping participants with the knowledge and skills to
    enhance their contributions to quality control and research within the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
